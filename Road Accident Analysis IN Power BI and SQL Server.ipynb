    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Road accidents stand as a formidable global challenge, exacting a toll in terms of human lives, injuries, and substantial economic losses year after year. Despite concerted efforts by authorities to instill road safety measures, the persistent high incidence of accidents in numerous countries underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to these incidents. In response to this imperative, this project, \"Driving Towards Safety,\" endeavors to embark on an extensive exploration of the multifaceted dimensions surrounding road accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to dissect the intricate web of factors influencing road accidents through a dual approachâ€”leveraging the power of Structured Query Language (SQL) for meticulous data analysis and harnessing the visualization capabilities of PowerBI to convey insights effectively. The project will delve into various dimensions, including the geographic distribution of casualties, monthly trends, vehicle conditions, the state of road infrastructure, and environmental variables. By conducting a thorough investigation into these aspects, This project aspire to unearth patterns, correlations, and insights that can empower authorities in formulating targeted strategies to mitigate the risk of road accidents and, ultimately, save lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is not merely an exploration of statistics; it is a proactive step towards actionable knowledge. The findings derived from this analysis aim to serve as a foundation upon which authorities can build robust and effective road safety initiatives. Through a combination of rigorous data analysis and intuitive visual representation, \"Driving Towards Safety\" seeks to contribute to a safer and more secure global road network, fostering environments where accidents are minimized, and lives are safeguarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Create a Road Accident dashboard for clients for year 2011 so that they can have insight in the below requirements\n",
    "- Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and Year over year growth\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary KPI's - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and Year over Year growth\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year\n",
    "\n",
    "- Casualties by Road Type for Current year\n",

    "- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sourcing\n",
    "Not until I came up with the above mentioned questions did I went ahead to get the data online. I then downloaded the [CSV File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1po_7QivCqGceixWVXCoX_ftzf8scG-sl/edit?usp=drive_link), before loading into Power BI for cleaning, analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains 3 sheets/tables:\n",
    "307,973 rows and 14 columns\n",
    "\n",

    "### Data Transformation/Cleaning:\n",
    "Data was efficiently cleaned and transformed with the Power Query Editor of Power BI.\n",
    "Some of the applied steps included \n",
    "\n",
    "- Renaming inconsistent data points in Accident_Severity column from Fetal to Fatal.\n",
    "- Create calender table\n",
    "- Create new features Year, Month, Date from calender table\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATA MODELLING\n",
    "The 'Data' table is the fact table of the model.\n",
    "The remaining dimension tables which I create as time inteligence table; 'Calender' table is connected to the 'Data' table via the common columns: 'Date'.\n",

    "### Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Targeted Safety Campaigns:**\n",
    "   - Given the significant drop in overall casualties and accidents, continue and expand targeted safety campaigns. Focus on educating drivers and promoting responsible behavior on the roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Road Infrastructure:**\n",
    "   - Address the high proportion of casualties on single carriage roads by investing in road infrastructure improvements. Consider widening roads, implementing safety barriers, and enhancing visibility to reduce accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Daytime Safety Measures:**\n",
    "   - Allocate resources to improve road safety during daytime hours, which account for the majority of accidents. This could involve increased law enforcement, improved signage, and public awareness campaigns tailored to daytime driving risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Urban Safety Initiatives:**\n",
    "   - Prioritize urban areas in road safety initiatives, given the higher percentage of casualties. Implement measures such as improved traffic management, pedestrian safety measures, and enhanced infrastructure in urban zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Vehicle Safety Standards:**\n",
    "   - Given the prevalence of car accidents, emphasize and enforce vehicle safety standards. Encourage the use of modern safety features, conduct regular vehicle inspections, and promote awareness of safe driving practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Monthly and Seasonal Awareness Programs:**\n",
    "   - Launch targeted awareness programs during November, the peak month for casualties, and during the identified seasonal trends. These programs can include increased law enforcement, educational campaigns, and heightened public awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positive Trend in Road Safety:**\n",
    "   - The drop in the number of casualties and accidents indicates a positive trend in road safety, potentially reflecting the effectiveness of existing safety measures and awareness campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Impact of Safety Measures:**\n",
    "   - The substantial drop in severity for fatal cases and slight casualties suggests that safety measures, whether regulatory or educational, are having a tangible impact on reducing the severity of accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Need for Rural Safety Focus:**\n",
    "   - Despite the overall positive trend, there is a need to focus on rural areas where casualties are still prevalent. Tailored safety initiatives, improved road signage, and increased law enforcement will be particularly beneficial in these regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Daytime Driving Challenges:**\n",
    "   - The majority of casualties occurring during daytime hours highlight the specific challenges and risks associated with daytime driving. Addressing factors such as distracted driving and improving road conditions during daylight will further enhance safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Understanding Seasonal Trends:**\n",
    "   - Recognizing distinct seasonal casualty trends provides an opportunity for proactive safety measures. Authorities should implement targeted campaigns and resources during specific periods to mitigate the impact of seasonal variations on road safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the project's findings offer valuable insights that can guide authorities in refining and developing road safety strategies. The positive trends indicate progress, while identified areas of concern provide clear targets for focused interventions.\n"
